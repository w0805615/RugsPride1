My assigned Product is Rugs to generate a product catalog allowing for CRUD operations.
The six properties of my product are Brand, Color, Pattern, Price, Shape, and Material. Additionally, ID is a primary key, and when we will add a new field, I will add Rating as my new property to the object.

Created Welcome page
Created Git Repository

Started part 1
Completed Part 1 of tutorial 

Started Part 2
455 ET
Added a new controller : RugController
Changed the content of controller based on the tutorial 
tested it in the browser
for now skipped the Welcome method to include two parameters

Completed part 2 of tutorial

Started Part 3 Add a view 515 ET

Replaced the Index method with the given code because currently the Index method returns a string with a message in the controller class.
And this calls the controller's View method
Created a new folder named Rug and added a new item with Razor view- empty and named that file Index.cshtml

Trying to add live date and time and added line in index.cshtml 
It's Okay I will add it later.

 Continue...

 Didn’t forget to Clean the code. 
Then Build it again and checked the terminal to see succeeded 1, and failed 0.
Then Run the code to test it by pressing IIS Express.

Now Checking the content of the Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file with the given markup.

Everthing looks fine. 
Ready to move on next step.

In the tutorial I can see the difference between the two titles.

Changing title of Index.cshtml view file along with the title of the page.

Part 3 of the tutorial: Add a view is completed 630ET

NO ERROR till now.
Going smoothly!
